A collection of free apps and resources to help you with Remote Work during the Coronavirus Pandemic Crisis.

## How to contribute

Edit the file `/src/markdown/apps.md` and add the apps you believe that can bring value to remote workers, especially during the Coronavirus Pandemic Crisis.

This is a `markdown` file. If you don't know what markdown is, no problem, [here is a link to quick intro.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) And here is a [Markdown Cheatsheet with the basic syntax](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

As soon as your contribution is merged, a Github Action will kick in and deploy a new version of the website.
